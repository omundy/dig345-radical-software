- Git Milestones `10%`
- Javascript Proficiency `10%`
- Presentation `10%`
- Final Project `40%`





## DevLogs

<CustomAside type="info" oneline="true">A journal of your learning progress (technical and otherwise).</CustomAside>

Throughout this course you will write about and document what you learn, adding text, images, and other media to reinforce concepts from the course. Describing new materials in your own words not only increases learning, but allows you to track your progress, debug and share your design and technical solutions, and lets you refer back to this material after this semester. See the Schedule for setup and list of DevLogs, and follow these tips:

- Add text, images, videos, links to tutorials, code, examples, etc.
- Use `.md` or `.mdx` files to add rich text formatting and improve readability.
- Name the files appropriately (e.g. `devlog-2-1.mdx`) to make them easy to find.
- Update and commit your work often so we can refer to it in class. 
- Post in Moodle a direct link to the file where prompted.
- The deadlines are listed in the schedule.

{/* 
Add this to DevLogs
A follow-up comment in response to another student’s comments (if you weren’t first). */}



### 📚 Reading Responses

Use the following outline when the DevLogs ask for a reading response. Links and references should be properly cited using a style of your choice.

- A summary of the content
- 1 quote from the content
- 1 related comment on the content
- 1 related discussion question (a prompt you would like to explore in class)
- Share a related work of art, design, or technology that relates to the text(s) and reflect it is so.

## Presentation

Find
1. A cultural item
1. A theory
1. An example that might be inspired by this concept 


- Early generative art: Sol LeWitt, [Stanley Brouwn](https://www.moma.org/artists/29982-stanley-brouwn), Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, Vera Molnár, Sonia Landy Sheridan, and [Lillian Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAlXN-F2vPQ)
- Demoscene



Students choose from a "connection" subject for a presentation+activity that explores the history, technology, people, works that lie at the intersection of one of the following (or propose one). Incorporate additional articles and research...

Demoscene + #algorave

HCI + Xerox Parc


Look at computer art history for more examples....






## Final Project 

Technology has always been complicated. It embodies the dreams as much as the failures of our species. It accelerates the possibility we might improve and ease the burdens of humankind, yet continues to allow us to cause harm and inequality. The tech that Facebook creates is considered innovative, not because it makes the world better, safer, or more humane, but due to its ability to capture attention, manipulate populations, and generate massive wealth for a few individuals. 

Recall however, technology is not only not neutral, it is also not yet self-deterministic. The messiness of technology mirrors our own possibilities and biases. The definition of "new" has equal subjectivity. The invention of the wheel, surely a big deal at its "launch party," allows humans unprecedented mobility as much as it accelerates us in our path to destroy the planet. 

Using the technology and context(s) from this course, you will create a final project is a departure from common functions of software.

{/* - Utility – One project will be useful, pragmatic, solve a problem, have utility, etc.
- No Utility – The other will be useless, speculative, create a problem, have no utility, etc. */}

At the outcome, you will have developed your concept, incorporating knowledge from the course to research, ideate, prototype, test, build and deploy a "thing", and importantly, describe your motivations, inspiration, process through an accompanying statement and documentation.

### Deliverables

Link to or paste in Moodle (see schedule for dates):

1. Brainstorm day - Come to class with ideas to discuss. Explore areas specific to your interests in https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/index/
1. Pitch - Google Presentation 8-10 slides rubric
	1. Description - Describe the project you will build in 2-3 sentences. How is it useful or not useful? Who will use this and why?
	1. Competition scan: Research and list inspiration and similar works; identify potential methods and tutorials describing components of your overall project. Include links, authors, title, dates, etc. Examples (2–3) show similar works (in concept or tech) with images and links.
	1. Other Planning / Graphics
		1. An initial attempt at an [identity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1exnY8fjVsOc3bKZFESJIM2s4JKxhqg_oASPDPokSfrE/edit?usp=sharing) (e.g. a logo, word mark, style guide, etc.).
		1. Flowcharts (1–3) showing user interfaces (UI) and experiences (UX), or algorithms, data flow, or schemas as needed (e.g. data paths in the app)
		1. [Wireframes](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/how-to-wireframe-website/) showing essential interface views and layouts (e.g. an introduction page, web forms, results and outcomes)
		1. Technology like [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) testing the main logic of your project. List tech and demos you may need including "unknowns" or aspects of your idea that you will learn to execute your project.
	1. Milestones: List 3 milestones towards finishing this project. Explain what you will have done on each.
1. Prototype – Create a working “proof of concept” of your app.
	1. Your prototype should contain the essential functions of your project.

	1. Save and refresh your work in the browser often to see your changes. Commit changes regularly.
1. Design – Design iterations of main views.
	1. The design should reflect the overall concept and goals of your project.
	1. Create your design iterations with [Figma](https://figma.com/), or use the Bootstrap template included in this repo designs/1.psd.
	1. Create multiple iterations of each different page / view your app.
	1. As per class presentations, look at relevant examples of good design to help you improve your own, then experiment and iterate!

## Recreate an existing work

Prompt 8.3 Add New Data to Your Project

It’s impressive how using variables and functions keeps the code modular, which organizes it and makes the code easy to build on. What would Jean Arp think? Now that you have a handle on using loops, arrays, and SVGs to create a generative work, continue to experiment with the interface, parameters, and concepts of your project as you create a generative browser experience inspired by the history of art and interactivity. Think about replayability as you do to encourage users to return to and play with your work as they experience new outcomes.

Here are some potential components you could include in your idea and execution:

1. **Randomness/chance** — Consider reflecting on the tension between decisions/definitions created by the artist/author and the elements that are left to randomization/chance.
2. **Color generation** — Will color information be purely random, or influenced by other factors like time, interactivity, or other data?
3. **Composition and form** — What rules will you use in creating and positioning objects?
4. **Sound/multimedia** — How might sound or other media add to your ideas?
5. **Rules** — How will decisions you make be informed by the work you are inspired by? How might you put your project in conversation with art history? Think also about the discussion of fair use, notably with respect to the notion of transformation, in chapter 2.
6. **Customization(s)** — What interactivity might you add to allow the viewer to appreciate,  modify, or play with the work? How might you encourage replayability as users return or revisit the page? 

Regardless of your approach, your project should mimic or somehow find inspiration in these processes to reflect your own thinking on the subject.
