## 📚 Reading Responses

For each 📚 chapter Context in the schedule, please read the text and then post a Moodle response by 8pm the day before it appears. Links and references should be properly cited using a style of your choice. Your response should include:

- A summary of the text(s)
- 1 quote from the text(s)
- 1 related comment on the text(s)
- 1 related discussion question (a prompt you would like to explore in class)
- Share 2 works of art or design from the web that relate to the text(s) and reflect on why you chose them.
- 1 follow-up comment in response to another student’s comments (if you weren’t first).




## Git Milestones

<CustomAside type="info" oneline="true">A list of student competencies for Git and Github.</CustomAside>

Git and Github will be essential in this class. Post a link to your finished (both part 1 and 2) [Git Milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repo in Moodle. If you have completed this previously then you can link to your finished repo.




## DevLog

<CustomAside type="info" oneline="true">A journal of your learning progress (technical and otherwise).</CustomAside>

Each week you will write about and document what you learn in this class, adding text, images, and other media to reinforce concepts from the course. Describing new materials in your own words not only increases learning, but also allows you to track your progress, debug and share your solutions to design and solve technical problems, and refer back to this material after this semester. Keep notes about the work you do using this structure:

1. See the Schedule for the list of DevLogs.
1. Add text, images, links to tutorials, code, examples, etc.
1. Use basic rich text formatting to improve readability.
1. Share it me (I should be able to add comments) and make it visible by everyone at Davidson (so we can share in group activities)
1. 
1. Post a link directly to the file in Moodle where prompted.








## Potential Presentation Subjects

Find
1. A cultural item
1. A theory
1. An example that might be inspired by this concept 


- Early generative art: Sol LeWitt, [Stanley Brouwn](https://www.moma.org/artists/29982-stanley-brouwn), Georg Nees, Frieder Nake, Vera Molnár, Sonia Landy Sheridan, and [Lillian Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAlXN-F2vPQ)
- Demoscene



Students choose from a "connection" subject for a presentation+activity that explores the history, technology, people, works that lie at the intersection of one of the following (or propose one). Incorporate additional articles and research...

Demoscene + #algorave

HCI + Xerox Parc


Look at computer art history for more examples....






## Final Project

## Recreate an existing work

Prompt 8.3 Add New Data to Your Project

It’s impressive how using variables and functions keeps the code modular, which organizes it and makes the code easy to build on. What would Jean Arp think? Now that you have a handle on using loops, arrays, and SVGs to create a generative work, continue to experiment with the interface, parameters, and concepts of your project as you create a generative browser experience inspired by the history of art and interactivity. Think about replayability as you do to encourage users to return to and play with your work as they experience new outcomes.

Here are some potential components you could include in your idea and execution:

1. **Randomness/chance** — Consider reflecting on the tension between decisions/definitions created by the artist/author and the elements that are left to randomization/chance.
2. **Color generation** — Will color information be purely random, or influenced by other factors like time, interactivity, or other data?
3. **Composition and form** — What rules will you use in creating and positioning objects?
4. **Sound/multimedia** — How might sound or other media add to your ideas?
5. **Rules** — How will decisions you make be informed by the work you are inspired by? How might you put your project in conversation with art history? Think also about the discussion of fair use, notably with respect to the notion of transformation, in chapter 2.
6. **Customization(s)** — What interactivity might you add to allow the viewer to appreciate,  modify, or play with the work? How might you encourage replayability as users return or revisit the page? 

Regardless of your approach, your project should mimic or somehow find inspiration in these processes to reflect your own thinking on the subject.
