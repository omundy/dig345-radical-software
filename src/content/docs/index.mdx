## 1-2 Introduction 

<CustomAside type="discussion" oneline="true">First day activity 
<IconTime>:20 min</IconTime></CustomAside>



{/* 
Give them a simple course-related task to complete, and offer a brief injunction before they start: 
*/}

##### Part 1

1. **Pair up** (ideally with someone you haven't met previously) and introduce yourself.
1. **Discuss** How do you define "[radical](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/radical_adj?tl=true) software"? Find an example and explain why it fits.
1. **Write** a short list of steps (as pseudocode) for someone who might act out the tasks of a simple example of radical software. A human should be able to perform the steps (as if testing them) in less than 5 minutes. Your software need not be intentionally good or bad—just functional. There are no wrong answers!

#### Part 2

1. **Join** with another pair to form a group of 2 pairs.
1. **Perform** the pseudocode steps from the other pair while they watch and take notes. You can ask for guidance to keep moving, but try to interpret as best as you can on your own. 
1. **Switch** and perform the other group's "software".
1. **Make** notes to share with the class 
   1. Did the other pair follow the steps as you "coded" them? What went wrong (or right)?
   1. How do the outcomes change or depend based on who codes the software and their motivations?
   1. What is "radical software?"

{/* 
Part 3
- Which strategies have been effective, or ineffective, for you in the past?
- in order to understand, and build "radical software", make a list of individual actions they will need to take to do well in the course, and a list of actions they would like to see taken by you and their peers. Those lists can be shared and discussed in class, or afterward on the learning-management system
