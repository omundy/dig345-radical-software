## Assignments




### Reading Responses 

{/* TODO */}



### Git Milestones

Git and Github will be essential in this class. Post a link to your finished (both part 1 and 2) [Git Milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repo in Moodle. If you have completed this previously then re-post.




### DevLog (Tech Homework & Exercises)

The DevLog will be a journal of your learning progress (technical and otherwise). Each week you will write about and document what you learn in class exercises and your tech book, adding text, images, and other media to reinforce concepts from the course. Describing new materials in your own words not only increases learning, but also allows you to track your progress, debug and share your solutions to design and technical problems, and refer back to this material after this semester. We will review this document several times in class. Keep notes about the work you do using this structure:


1. Create a Google Doc to add text, images, links to tutorials, code, examples, etc.
1. Use basic rich text formatting to distinguish weeks/sections.
1. Share it me (I should be able to add comments) and make it visible by everyone at Davidson (so we can share in group activities)
1. In class, simply show me these things are working and be ready to answer questions about them.  
1. Just post the same link in Moodle where prompted so I can find it.








## Potential Presentation Subjects

1. A cultural item

## Recreate an existing work

Prompt 8.3 Add New Data to Your Project
It’s impressive how using variables and functions keeps the code modular, which organizes
it and makes the code easy to build on. What would Jean Arp think? Now that you have a
handle
on using loops, arrays, and SVGs to create a generative work, continue to experiment
with the interface, parameters,
and concepts of your project
as you create a generative
browser experience inspired by the history of art and interactivity. Think about replayability
as you do to encourage users to return to and play with your work as they experience
new outcomes.
Here
are some potential components you could include in your idea and execution:
1. Randomness/chance—Consider
reflecting on the tension between decisions/definitions
created by the artist/author and the elements
that are left to randomization/chance.
2. Color generation—Will
color information be purely random, or influenced by other
factors
like time, interactivity, or other data?
3. Composition and form—What
rules will
you use in creating and positioning objects?
4. Sound/multimedia—How
might sound or other media add to your ideas?
5. Rules—How
will
decisions you make be informed by the work you are inspired by? How
might you put your project
in conversation with art history? Think also about the discussion
of fair use, notably with respect
to the notion of transformation, in chapter 2.
6. Customization(s)—What
interactivity might you add to allow the viewer to appreciate,
modify, or play with the work? How might you encourage replayability as users return
or revisit the page?
Regardless of your approach, your project
should mimic or somehow find inspiration in
these
processes
to reflect your own thinking on the subject.
