## About Jamstack websites

The website you are viewing is a 1) JAMstack site, 2) generated using 3) Astro 4) Starlight. 

1. [**JAMstack**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-jamstack/) sites are static websites (`HTML/CSS/JS`) generated from dynamic content. When you publish a markdown file to Github and it transforms it into a webpage you are making a JAMstack site. JAM stands for Javascript + APIs + markup used to create the static website.
1. A [**Static Site Generator (SSG)**](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) is a tool that creates a static site using plain text files (usually Markdown `.md` or `.mdx`) and a collection of templates.
1. [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) is a Javascript framework capable of generating static (or dynamic) websites. You add content using markdown and Astro manages all the organization, building (creating HTML from MD files using templates), and publishing. 
1. [**Starlight**](https://starlight.astro.build/) is a documentation theme for Astro, adding templates, and components for navigation, search, and other features.

### JAMstack benefits 

1. The frontend is static, so it displays information without latency.
1. With no backend, the site runs faster, has better security, and hosting is cheap (even free).
1. The site can scale easily and traffic static content can be offloaded to a CDN. 






:::note[Use [Astro.js](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/) on its own!]

- Astro is popular and flexible as you can see in their [showcase](https://astro.build/showcase/).
- Even if most of your site is static, you can use dynamic data and reactive frameworks (i.e. React, Svelte, etc.) with [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#island-components).
- You can convert TXT, CSV, or JSON data, or even a local database to a static site. See "[Convert a PHP/MySQL site to Jamstack and host on Github Pages](https://owenmundy.com/blog/2025/11/convert-a-php-mysql-site-to-jamstack-and-host-on-github-pages/)" (2024) where I describe rebuilding [camplajolla.org](https://omundy.github.io/camplajolla/) using Astro and MySQL.
- There are many themes available: [accessible-astro](https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-starter), [astro-bootstrap](https://astro-bootstrap.github.io/), [bloomfolio](https://github.com/lauroguedes/bloomfolio), [saral](https://yashjawale.in/saral-theme-astro/blog/)

{/* <details>
<summary>Instructions for creating a Starlight site from scratch</summary>
</details> */}

### Create an Astro Starlight site

Follow these steps from [Starlight's Getting Started tutorial](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/)

1. Create new folder named `astro-test` inside `~/Documents/Github/` 
1. Drag the folder into VS Code in the dock (Mac) to open the project.
1. Run the following in a VS Code Terminal to start the installation
```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```
4. *Where should we create your new project?* `./`
1. *Install dependencies?* `Yes`
1. *Initialize a new git repository?* `Yes`
1. Once finished, run the development server then find your new site at: http://localhost:4321
```
npm run dev
```






### Project structure

Inside your intial Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:


import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<figure>
<FileTree>

- public/ Static files 
- src/ All files in here will be processed by Astro
  - assets/ Static files processed by Astro 
  - content/ In a regular Astro site these become routes
    - docs/
      - contents/ Folders/Files here become sections/pages in your site
    - index.mdx Site home page
- astro.config.mjs Astro/Starlight config file
- package.json Meta information and project dependencies

</FileTree>
</figure>

- Starlight publishes `.md` and `.mdx` files in `/src/content/docs/` to the web using directory/filename (e.g. `guides/example`)
- `/src/assets/`- Place images here then embed them in Markdown with a relative link.
- `public/` - This directory is for static assets, like favicons.
- `astro.config.mjs` - The Astro config file
- `package.json` - This file contains your project dependencies as well as a list of commands for testing and building Astro. 

{/* 
- `npm install` - Installs dependencies                         
- `npm run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`     
- `npm run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`         
- `npm run preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying 
*/}


### Update project structure

1. Make a new folder called `schedule` in `/src/content/docs/`
1. Add a new file called `devlog-1-2.mdx` inside `/src/content/docs/schedule/`
1. To the top add a "frontmatter" section:

```
---
title: DevLog 1-2
description: DevLog page 
---
```

4. Below the frontmatter in `devlog-1-2.mdx` add this outline:
```

```
5. In VS Code, open `astro.config.mjs`
1. Set `title` to `DevLog`
1. Add `{ label: 'Schedule', autogenerate: { directory: 'schedule' }, },` into the `sidebar` property 

```mjs
export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'DevLog',
      ...
      sidebar: [
				{ label: 'Schedule', autogenerate: { directory: 'schedule' }, },
			],
		}),
	],
})
```

8. Add a `.gitignore` file to the main directory with the following 

```
# build output
dist/
# generated types
.astro/

# dependencies
node_modules/

# logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*


# environment variables
.env
.env.production

# macOS-specific files
.DS_Store
```



{/* https://github.com/omundy/dig345-devlog */}






### Publish Astro/Starlight using Github Actions

1. In Github Desktop, commit your work and push it to a new repository on Github. Leave it public.
1. Open the repo web page **Github Desktop > Repository > View on Github**. Click Settings > Pages. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the Source of your site.
1. In VS Code, open `astro.config.mjs`
   1. Set `site` to the github.io URL for your username. For example my username is `omundy`
   1. Set `base` to the name of your repo. For example my repo is `dig345-devlog`

```mjs
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://omundy.github.io',
  base: '/dig345-devlog',
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'DevLog',
      sidebar: [
				{ label: 'Schedule', autogenerate: { directory: 'schedule' }, },
			],
		}),
	],
})
```
4. In VS Code, right click the empty area in your Explorer below the project files and choose New File... Paste the following path to auto-create the folders and directories for the deploy file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (and can also make these individually). Don't forget the perio in front of "github".
1. Paste the YAML code from https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/ into `deploy.yml` 
1. Go to your published site at https://omundy.github.io/dig345-devlog


:::caution
If you don't see your site here check https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/actions for issues. Ensure GitHub Pages has been enabled!

### Add custom CSS to your theme

From Astro [documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles)

1. Add a folder called `styles` to your `/src/` directory. 
1. Add a file called `custom.css` to `/src/styles/` directory. 
1. Paste in the following code. This will set a wider default column width and larger text size for page titles:

```
:root {
  --sl-content-width: 50rem;
}
```

4. Add the path to your CSS file to Starlight’s `customCss` array in `astro.config.mjs`:

```mjs
export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'DevLog',
			...
			customCss: [
				'./src/styles/custom.css', // relative path to custom CSS file
			],
		}),
	],
})
```





### Add an aside 

Use Starlight's [custom Markdown syntax](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#asides) to add an aside component.

```
:::caution[Github Actions]
If you don't see your site check https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/actions for issues.
:::
```





### Import and use an Astro component

Use Starlight's built-in [`<Icon>` component](https://starlight.astro.build/components/icons/).

1. Open an `.mdx` file and paste this content below the frontmatter.

```
import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Icon name="open-book" />  Learn more about [icons](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/#all-icons)
```

2. Add this rule to `custom.css`

```
.sl-markdown-content .inline-icon {
  display: inline;
}
```

3. You should see this component rendered like so: 

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Icon name="open-book" class="inline-icon" />  Learn more about [icons](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/#all-icons)


4. Update the [icon](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/#all-icons) 



:::caution
If you change the dependencies in your `package.json` file you will need to 
1. Delete the `package-lock.json`
1. Delete the `node_modules/`
1. Run `npm install` to regenerate the above.

## More Topics





### Not-Content

The `not-content` CSS class disables Starlight's default, automatic styling (e.g., margins, spacing) for the content inside it, preventing conflicts when you're adding custom components or complex layouts that need precise control over spacing. Essentially, it tells Starlight, "Don't touch these elements with your standard styles; let my component handle it". 

```js
<div class="not-content">
  <p>This paragraph won't have default Starlight margins.</p>
  <button>A custom button</button>
</div>
```



### Configure @ Aliases

[Aliases](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/imports/#aliases) can help improve the development experience in codebases with many directories or relative imports.

1. Open `tsconfig.json` located at the root of your project. Astro projects include a `tsconfig.json` file by default.
1. Add `baseUrl` and `paths` to the `compilerOptions` object. The `baseUrl` should be set to `.` (the project root), and the `paths` define your aliases. A common setup uses `@/` to point to the `/src/` directory.
1. Restart your development server to ensure the changes are picked up. 


```ts
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",
  "include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@/layouts/*": ["src/layouts/*"],
      "@/assets/*": ["src/assets/*"],
      "@/styles/*": ["src/styles/*"],
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

The above changes this 

```mdx
---
import Button from '../../components/controls/Button.astro';
---
```

To this: 
```mdx
---
import Button from '@/components/controls/Button.astro';
---
```




### Override a component 

The most up to date instructions can be found [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/). 

1. Add a folder in `/src/components/`
1. Create a new file called `EmailLink.astro` in `/src/components/` and add the following: 

```mdx
---
const email = 'houston@example.com';
---

<a href=`mailto:${email}`>E-mail Me</a>
```

1. Tell Starlight to use your custom component in the components configuration option in `astro.config.mjs`:

```mjs
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'DevLog',
      ...
      components: {
        // Override the default `SocialIcons` component.
        SocialIcons: './src/components/EmailLink.astro',
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```








### Add Tailwind to Starlight

[Instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro)

```
npx astro add tailwind
```

:::caution
Note that Tailwind uses [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) that removes all base styles, including things you might expect to not be removed like [lists](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight#lists-are-unstyled)
