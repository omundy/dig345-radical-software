## 1-2 Introduction

<CustomAside type="discussion" oneline="true">First day activity 
<IconTime>:20 min</IconTime></CustomAside>

{/* 
Give them a simple course-related task to complete, and offer a brief injunction before they start: 
*/}

#### Part 1

1. **Pair up** (ideally with someone you haven't met previously) and introduce yourself.
1. **Discuss** How do you define "[radical](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/radical_adj?tl=true) software"? Find an example and explain why it fits.
1. **Write** a short list of steps (as pseudocode) for someone who might act out the tasks of a simple example of radical software. A human should be able to perform the steps (as if testing them) in less than 5 minutes. Your software need not be intentionally good or bad—just functional. There are no wrong answers!

#### Part 2

1. **Join** with another pair to form a group of 2 pairs.
1. **Perform** the pseudocode steps from the other pair while they watch and take notes. You can ask for guidance to keep moving, but try to interpret as best as you can on your own. 
1. **Switch** and perform the other group's "software".
1. **Make** notes to share with the class 
   1. Did the other pair follow the steps as you "coded" them? What went wrong (or right)?
   1. How do the outcomes change based on who codes the software and their motivations?
   1. What is "radical software?"

{/* 
Part 3
- Which strategies have been effective, or ineffective, for you in the past?
- in order to understand, and build "radical software", make a list of individual actions they will need to take to do well in the course, and a list of actions they would like to see taken by you and their peers. Those lists can be shared and discussed in class, or afterward on the learning-management system

### DevLog 1-3 

#### Create a Node.js project and publish it on Github

This [Introduction to NPM and Node](https://omundy.github.io/learn-javascript/topics/node/slides.html) tutorial builds a foundation for what you will learn in this class. Below find the learning objectives for this DevLog which correspond to sections in the tutorial. Save the information with the ✏️ which you will enter in your DevLog in the next class. <IconTime>:40 min</IconTime>

1. Install and use Node.js on your machine
1. Confirm your Node version ✏️`VERSION_NUMBER`
1. Run a script with Node.js
1. Initialize a new project with NPM
1. Install Nodemon globally to automatically reload scripts
1. Install the Cron NPM package and use it in a script
1. [Look up](https://crontab.guru) the cron expression for "every 10 minutes". Test it and add it ✏️`HERE` {/* https://crontab.guru/every-10-minutes */}
1. Create a Git repo and commit a `.gitignore` file
1. Publish the cron-demo repo on Github. Add the link ✏️ HERE
1. Turn it in by posting the Github link in Moodle

:::caution
Git is required for all course assignments. Complete parts 1 & 2 of the [Git Milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) if you have not already. Talk to me if you already have significant experience with Git and can demonstrate proficiency.
